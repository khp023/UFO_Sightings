# UFO_Sightings

## Overview

The following is an upgrade and addition in functionality of a website aimed at documenting reports of UFO sightings. The prior iteration of the website only allowed for the filtering of the data table by date; the resulting allowed for filtering by city, state, country, and also the shape of the reported sighting. 

The process was performed by applying Javascript to a compiled dataset. 


## Results

The initial iteration of the website required a button in order to initiate the search (by date). The new iteration just requires entering the value into the filter search field and pressing enter for it to update. Refer to the before and after shown below:

Sort by a state (ex. or for oregon):

## Summary 
Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.

In this current stage, the website is indeed able to filter by the new categories shown to narrow down the results that match that criteria. 

A drawback to this current method is the requirement to filter with ID's that are identical to those in the data table. It can be improved to be more of a search engine rather than a filtering technique by allowing for searching for key words that are close enough to what's being searched. 

An additional function that can be iterated would be a visualization method that updated with each filter- similar to how Microsoft Excel's PivotTables and PivotCharts can behave.
